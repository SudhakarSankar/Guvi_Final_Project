# Guvi Final Projects

Project Overview

This repository contains four projects completed as part of the final project for the GUVI institute. Each project focuses on different domains of machine learning, image processing, and natural language processing.

Projects

1. E-Commerce Customer Prediction

Predicts whether an online visitor will convert into a customer based on factors like device type, session type, searches, and other behavioral attributes.

Uses machine learning classification techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

Helps e-commerce businesses understand customer behavior and optimize conversion strategies.

2. Image Processing

Performs various image processing techniques, including:

Grayscale conversion

Sharpness enhancement

Blurring

De-blurring

Displays the processed images for comparison and evaluation.

3. Text Processing using NLP

Processes text data from a file and performs essential NLP tasks, including:

Tokenization

Stemming and Lemmatization

Stopword removal

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Sentiment Analysis

Results are displayed upon button click in a user-friendly interface.

4. Recommendation System

A recommendation system designed for an e-commerce platform.

When a buyer enters a product, the system suggests 5 recommended products based on the input.

Uses collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques to generate recommendations.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

OpenCV (for image processing)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning and recommendation systems)

Streamlit (for interactive user interfaces)

NLTK & Stanza (for NLP tasks)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

How to Use

Clone this repository.

Install the required dependencies.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for each project.

Interact with the models and visualize results using Streamlit where applicable.

Conclusion

These projects cover a range of practical applications, including customer behavior prediction, image enhancement, NLP-based text processing, and recommendation systems. They demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and interactive application development.
